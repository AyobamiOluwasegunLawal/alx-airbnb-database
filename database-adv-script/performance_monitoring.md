Database Performance Monitoring & Optimization
Objective

Continuously monitor and refine database performance by analyzing query execution plans and making schema-level improvements to ensure efficient and scalable database operations.

Overview

This task focuses on identifying performance bottlenecks in frequently used SQL queries, analyzing their execution behavior, and implementing optimizations such as indexing and schema refinement. Performance is measured before and after improvements to demonstrate effectiveness.

Steps Performed
1. Query Performance Monitoring

Executed frequently used queries and monitored performance metrics using:

EXPLAIN ANALYZE

EXPLAIN

SHOW PROFILE (if supported in the MySQL version)

These commands helped analyze:

Query execution path

Index usage

I/O operations

CPU time

Potential slow operations (table scans, temporary tables, etc.)

2. Bottleneck Identification

Common performance issues checked:

Full table scans on large tables

Unused or missing indexes

Inefficient joins

Sorting without indexes

Queries returning more data than necessary

3. Optimization & Schema Adjustments

Typical improvements implemented:

Creating or modifying indexes (B-Tree, composite indexes)

Adjusting schema constraints and data types where necessary

Refactoring queries to improve efficiency (avoiding subqueries when appropriate, using JOIN effectively)
